                <p>My portfolio showcases some of my best work as a web developer. With experience gained from Bay Valley Tech, 
                    I am proficient in designing and programming websites that are both functional and visually appealing. 
                    One of the projects I am particularly proud of is my email template project replicating some of the most popular emails websites today. 
                    This project can be shown in desktop, tablet, and mobile view using breakpoints from Bootstrap.

                    A simple website made for a friend for her Twitch channel. It uses mainly HTML and CSS. It has various links to her socials, the banner linking to her offical Twitch
                    so users can gain instant access to see her channel and increase traffic. It has an updated list of games she has played with images linking to her twitch clips corresponding
                    to the game. There is also a list of future games she will play on her channel. The style of the website is inspired by all the things she loves.

                Login UI website with a space theme. This project used only flexbox to center and align everything. 
                This is able to shrink with the browser and convert into column when the browser size is to small to be easily readable.
